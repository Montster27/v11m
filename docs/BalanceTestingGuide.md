**5 Optimal Strategies:**
- Knowledge Maximizer, Social Butterfly, Balanced Growth, Financial Focus, Wellness Focused

## How to Use

### Access the Balance Testing System

1. **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open Debug Panel**: Look for the üêû Debug tab on the right side of screen
3. **Navigate to Balance Tab**: Click "‚öñÔ∏è Balance" in the debug panel

### Running a Monte Carlo Simulation

1. **Set Parameters**:
   - Iterations: 50-100 for quick tests, 200+ for comprehensive analysis
   - Days: 30 for short-term, 90+ for long-term balance
   - Select archetypes to include

2. **Analyze Results**:
   - **Summary Stats**: Overall performance metrics
   - **Archetype Comparison**: Which strategies perform best/worst
   - **Balance Issues**: Overpowered/underpowered strategies detected
   - **Resource Analysis**: Final resource distributions

### Quick Balance Checks

**Console Commands** (available globally):
```javascript
// Get comprehensive balance analysis
analyzeBalance()

// Check for immediate bottlenecks
checkBottlenecks()

// Compare to optimal strategies
compareStrategies()
```

**Debug Panel Quick Tools**:
- üìä Resource Snapshot - Log current state
- üìà Weekly Projection - Project 1 week ahead
- üéØ Strategy Guide - Show optimal allocations
- üö® Balance Warnings - Check for issues

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Resource Balance
- **Resource Generation vs Consumption**: Are players gaining/losing resources over time?
- **Time Allocation Efficiency**: Which allocations provide best returns?
- **Bottleneck Detection**: What resources commonly limit progress?

### Player Progression
- **Skill/Domain Development**: How quickly do characters develop?
- **Quest/Storylet Completion**: Are content unlock rates appropriate?
- **Milestone Timing**: When do players reach key progression points?

### Balance Issues
- **Overpowered Strategies**: Strategies that significantly outperform others
- **Underpowered Strategies**: Strategies that consistently underperform
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: Resources that frequently limit progression
- **Progression Problems**: Issues with pacing or difficulty scaling

## Interpreting Results

### Performance Scores
- **Above 1.2x Average**: Potentially overpowered
- **Below 0.8x Average**: Potentially underpowered
- **0.8x - 1.2x Average**: Well balanced

### Resource Warnings
- **Energy < 30**: Low energy limiting activities
- **Stress > 70**: High stress affecting performance
- **Knowledge/Day < 2**: Slow academic progress
- **Social/Day < 1.5**: Insufficient social development

### Strategy Recommendations
- **High Similarity (>80%)**: Already following optimal strategy
- **Medium Similarity (60-80%)**: Minor adjustments needed
- **Low Similarity (<60%)**: Consider alternative approach

## Balance Adjustment Guidelines

### Overpowered Strategies
1. **Reduce Resource Generation**: Lower base rates for dominant activities
2. **Add Costs/Penalties**: Introduce stress, energy costs, or diminishing returns
3. **Increase Requirements**: Make achievements require more diverse development

### Underpowered Strategies
1. **Increase Rewards**: Boost resource generation or add unique benefits
2. **Reduce Costs**: Lower stress/energy costs for struggling activities
3. **Add Synergies**: Create bonuses for combining multiple activities

### Resource Bottlenecks
1. **Increase Generation**: Boost generation rates for bottlenecked resources
2. **Reduce Consumption**: Lower costs that drain bottlenecked resources
3. **Add Alternative Sources**: Provide multiple ways to gain critical resources

## Technical Implementation

### Simulation Architecture
- Uses actual game resource calculation functions
- Simulates character progression using domain XP system
- Tracks bottlenecks, achievements, and progression milestones
- Provides statistical analysis with standard deviation and percentiles

### Integration Points
- **Resource Calculations**: `calculateDomainResourceEffects()`
- **Character System**: Integrated character domains and progression
- **Storylet System**: Quest/storylet completion simulation
- **Save System**: No interference with actual game saves

### Performance Considerations
- Large simulations (500+ iterations) may take several minutes
- Progress callbacks provide real-time feedback
- Results cached for analysis without re-running
- Stress tests are lighter weight for quick feedback

## Example Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   ```javascript
   // Quick check of current balance
   analyzeBalance()
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - Run 100-iteration, 30-day Monte Carlo simulation
   - Review archetype performance comparison
   - Identify overpowered/underpowered strategies

3. **Stress Testing**:
   - Run stress tests to check edge cases
   - Verify extreme allocations don't break the game

4. **Balance Adjustments**:
   - Modify resource calculation rates in `resourceCalculations.ts`
   - Adjust storylet rewards/penalties
   - Re-test with simulations

5. **Validation**:
   - Run follow-up simulations to confirm improvements
   - Use quick tools for ongoing monitoring

This system provides data-driven insights for maintaining engaging and balanced gameplay across different player styles and strategies.
