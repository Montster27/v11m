# MMV Integrated Character System: One-Page Overview

## 🎯 **What's Changing**

**From**: 16 separate attributes across 4 categories  
**To**: 7 integrated domains with developmental progression  
**Why**: Simpler interface + meaningful psychological growth + Chickering's research-backed framework

## 🧠 **The New Seven Domains**

| Domain | Focus | Current Mapping | Development Stages |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **🧠 Intellectual Competence** | Reasoning, innovation, retention | Intelligence + Creativity + Memory + Focus | Learning → Applying → Analyzing → Expert → Innovator |
| **💪 Physical Competence** | Power, coordination, discipline | Strength + Agility + Endurance + Dexterity | Novice → Capable → Athletic → Master → Peak |
| **❤️ Emotional Intelligence** | Awareness, regulation, resilience | EmotionalStability + StressTolerance + SelfControl | Reactive → Aware → Managing → Mastery → Teacher |
| **👥 Social Competence** | Connection, communication, relationships | Charisma + Empathy + Communication | Isolated → Connected → Intimate → Interdependent → Mentoring |
| **🎯 Personal Autonomy** | Independence, interdependence, responsibility | *New* (derived from SelfControl + Perseverance) | Dependent → Independent → Interdependent → Leading → Mentoring |
| **🔍 Identity Clarity** | Self-awareness, values, authenticity | *New* (derived from emotional attributes) | Exploring → Experimenting → Committing → Integrated → Evolved |
| **🌟 Life Purpose** | Direction, meaning, integrity | *New* (derived from Perseverance + Focus) | Searching → Exploring → Clarifying → Committed → Fulfilled |

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Character Structure**
```typescript
// Old: 16 separate attributes
{ intelligence: 75, creativity: 68, memory: 82, focus: 71, ... }

// New: 7 integrated domains
intellectualCompetence: {
  level: 74,                    // Composite of old attributes
  developmentStage: 3,          // "Analyzing" stage
  experiencePoints: 420,        // Progress toward next stage
  confidence: 82,               // Self-confidence in domain
  components: {
    reasoning: 73,              // Intelligence + Focus
    innovation: 70,             // Creativity + Adaptability  
    retention: 77               // Memory + Perseverance
  }
}
```

### **Migration Strategy**
- **Seamless Transition**: Automatic conversion preserves all character data
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support both systems during transition
- **Enhanced Tracking**: New development events and milestone history
