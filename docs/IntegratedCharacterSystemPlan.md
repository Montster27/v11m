# Integrated Character System: Merging MMV Attributes with Chickering's Vectors

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a plan to merge MMV's current 16-attribute character model with Chickering's Seven Vectors of Development into a unified, simplified system that maintains simulation depth while adding meaningful psychological development. The integrated system reduces complexity while enhancing the personal growth experience through developmental progression.

## Current System Analysis

### MMV Current Model (16 Attributes)
```typescript
// Current: 16 separate attributes across 4 categories
cognitive: { intelligence, creativity, memory, focus }
physical: { strength, agility, endurance, dexterity }  
social: { charisma, empathy, communication }
mental: { emotionalStability, perseverance, stressTolerance, adaptability, selfControl }
```

### Chickering's Seven Vectors
1. Developing Competence (3 types: intellectual, physical, interpersonal)
2. Managing Emotions
3. Moving Through Autonomy Toward Interdependence  
4. Developing Mature Interpersonal Relationships
5. Establishing Identity
6. Developing Purpose
7. Developing Integrity

## Integration Strategy: The Seven-Domain Character System

### Core Philosophy
- **Simplify to 7 core domains** that map to Chickering's vectors
- **Maintain simulation depth** through composite scoring
- **Add developmental progression** within each domain
- **Preserve gameplay mechanics** while enhancing meaning

## Proposed Integrated Model

### 1. Intellectual Competence (Vector 1a)
**Combines**: `intelligence`, `creativity`, `memory`, `focus`
```typescript
intellectualCompetence: {
  level: number;           // 1-100 composite score
  components: {
    reasoning: number;     // intelligence + focus
    innovation: number;    // creativity + adaptability  
    retention: number;     // memory + perseverance
  };
  developmentStage: number; // 1-5 progression stages
  confidence: number;       // competence confidence (new)
}
```

### 2. Physical Competence (Vector 1b)  
**Combines**: `strength`, `agility`, `endurance`, `dexterity`
```typescript
physicalCompetence: {
  level: number;           // 1-100 composite score
  components: {
    power: number;         // strength + endurance
    coordination: number;  // agility + dexterity
    discipline: number;    // perseverance applied to physical
  };
  developmentStage: number;
  confidence: number;
}
```

### 3. Emotional Intelligence (Vector 2)
**Combines**: `emotionalStability`, `stressTolerance`, `selfControl` + new elements
```typescript
emotionalIntelligence: {
  level: number;
  components: {
    awareness: number;     // new: emotional self-awareness
    regulation: number;    // emotionalStability + selfControl
    resilience: number;    // stressTolerance + adaptability
  };
  developmentStage: number; // 1=reactive, 2=aware, 3=managing, 4=mastery, 5=teaching
  currentEmotions: string[]; // dynamic emotional state
}
```

### 4. Social Competence (Vector 1c + 4)
**Combines**: `charisma`, `empathy`, `communication` + relationship development
```typescript
socialCompetence: {
  level: number;
  components: {
    connection: number;    // charisma + empathy
    communication: number; // existing communication
    relationships: number; // new: relationship depth/maturity
  };
  developmentStage: number; // 1=isolated, 2=connected, 3=intimate, 4=interdependent, 5=mentoring
  relationshipCount: number;
  relationshipQuality: number;
}
```

### 5. Personal Autonomy (Vector 3)
**New Domain**: Autonomy/Interdependence development
```typescript
personalAutonomy: {
  level: number;
  components: {
    independence: number;   // new: self-reliance
    interdependence: number; // new: healthy collaboration
    responsibility: number; // perseverance + selfControl
  };
  developmentStage: number; // 1=dependent, 2=independent, 3=interdependent, 4=leading, 5=mentoring
  autonomyBalance: number;  // independence vs interdependence balance
}
```

### 6. Identity Clarity (Vector 5)
**New Domain**: Identity development and self-concept
```typescript
identityClarity: {
  level: number;
  components: {
    selfAwareness: number;  // new: understanding of self
    values: number;         // new: clarity of personal values
    authenticity: number;   // new: alignment between self and actions
  };
  developmentStage: number; // 1=exploring, 2=experimenting, 3=committing, 4=integrated, 5=evolved
  identityAchievement: number;
}
```

### 7. Life Purpose (Vector 6 + 7)
**New Domain**: Purpose and integrity integration
```typescript
lifePurpose: {
  level: number;
  components: {
    direction: number;      // new: clarity of life direction
    meaning: number;        // new: sense of meaning and fulfillment
    integrity: number;      // new: values-behavior alignment
  };
  developmentStage: number; // 1=searching, 2=exploring, 3=clarifying, 4=committed, 5=fulfilled
  purposeAlignment: number; // daily activities alignment with purpose
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Attribute Consolidation
**Goal**: Convert existing 16 attributes to 7 domains without losing data

```typescript
// Migration function
function migrateCharacterModel(oldCharacter: OldCharacter): NewCharacter {
  return {
    intellectualCompetence: {
      level: average([
        oldCharacter.intelligence,
        oldCharacter.creativity, 
        oldCharacter.memory,
        oldCharacter.focus
      ]),
      components: {
        reasoning: average([oldCharacter.intelligence, oldCharacter.focus]),
        innovation: average([oldCharacter.creativity, oldCharacter.adaptability]),
        retention: average([oldCharacter.memory, oldCharacter.perseverance])
      },
      developmentStage: calculateStage(level),
      confidence: 50 // default starting value
    },
    // ... repeat for other domains
  };
}
```

### Phase 2: Development Stage Implementation
**Goal**: Add developmental progression to existing gameplay

```typescript
interface DevelopmentStage {
  stage: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  requirements: number; // experience points needed
  unlocks: string[];    // new capabilities/storylets
}

const emotionalIntelligenceStages: DevelopmentStage[] = [
  {
    stage: 1,
    name: "Reactive",
    description: "Emotions often feel overwhelming and unpredictable",
    requirements: 0,
    unlocks: ["basic_emotion_storylets"]
  },
  {
    stage: 2, 
    name: "Aware",
    description: "Beginning to recognize emotional patterns",
    requirements: 200,
    unlocks: ["emotion_awareness_storylets", "stress_management_tools"]
  },
  // ... etc
];
```

### Phase 3: Storylet System Integration
**Goal**: Create development-focused storylets for each domain

```typescript
interface DevelopmentStorylet {
  id: string;
  targetDomain: keyof Character['domains'];
  requiredStage: number;
  maxStage: number;
  developmentPoints: number;
  choices: {
    text: string;
    effects: {
      domain: keyof Character['domains'];
      component?: string;
      change: number;
      developmentPoints: number;
    }[];
  }[];
}
```

## Simplified Character Interface

## Resource System Integration

### Simplified Resource Calculations
```typescript
// Before: Complex calculations using 16 attributes
// After: Streamlined calculations using 7 domains

function calculateEnergyDelta(character: Character, timeAllocation: TimeAllocation): number {
  const physicalCapacity = character.physicalCompetence.level;
  const emotionalResilience = character.emotionalIntelligence.level;
  const workEfficiency = character.intellectualCompetence.level;
  
  return (
    (timeAllocation.sleep * physicalCapacity / 100) +
    (timeAllocation.leisure * emotionalResilience / 100) -
    (timeAllocation.work * (100 - workEfficiency) / 100) -
    (timeAllocation.study * (100 - workEfficiency) / 100)
  );
}
```

### Development-Driven Events
```typescript
// Events triggered by development milestones
function checkDevelopmentEvents(character: Character): StoryletEvent[] {
  const events: StoryletEvent[] = [];
  
  // Identity crisis event when identity clarity is low but other domains are high
  if (character.identityClarity.level < 30 && averageOtherDomains(character) > 70) {
    events.push(generateIdentityCrisisEvent());
  }
  
  // Purpose exploration when reaching social competence stage 3
  if (character.socialCompetence.developmentStage >= 3 && 
      character.lifePurpose.developmentStage < 2) {
    events.push(generatePurposeExplorationEvent());
  }
  
  return events;
}
```
