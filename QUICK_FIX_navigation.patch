// Quick fix for Navigation.tsx to connect to new store system
// File: /Users/montysharma/V11M2/src/components/Navigation.tsx

// CHANGE LINE 3 FROM:
import { useAppStore } from '../store/useAppStore';

// TO:
import { useCoreGameStore } from '../stores/v2';

// CHANGE LINE 10 FROM:
const { userLevel, experience, day, activeCharacter, isTimePaused } = useAppStore();

// TO:
const { userLevel, experience, day, activeCharacter, isTimePaused } = useCoreGameStore(
  (state) => ({
    userLevel: state.player.level,
    experience: state.player.experience,
    day: state.world.day,
    activeCharacter: state.character,
    isTimePaused: state.world.isTimePaused
  })
);
