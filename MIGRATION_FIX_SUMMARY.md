# V2 Store Migration Fix Summary

## What We Did

We've updated the following components to use the V2 consolidated stores instead of the legacy stores:

### 1. ResourcePanel.tsx
- Changed from `useAppStore` to `useCoreGameStore`
- Resources now read from `state.player.resources`
- Added default values to handle empty V2 store data

### 2. TimeAllocationPanel.tsx  
- Changed from `useAppStore` and `useCharacterStore` to `useCoreGameStore`
- Time allocations now read from `state.world.timeAllocation`
- Character data from `state.character`
- Updated the update methods to use `updateWorld`

### 3. SkillsPanel.tsx
- Changed from `useAppStore` to `useCoreGameStore`
- Added placeholder skill structure (V2 skills need different implementation)
- Disabled skill XP methods temporarily (needs V2 implementation)

### 4. StoryletPanel.tsx
- Changed from `useStoryletStore` to `useNarrativeStore`
- Added placeholder methods (V2 storylets need different implementation)

## How to Test

1. **Clear everything and start fresh:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Or use the migration fix utility:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   fixV2StoreMigration();
   ```

3. **Test by:**
   - Creating a character
   - Check if Navigation shows the character name
   - Check if ResourcePanel shows correct values
   - Try adjusting time allocations
   - Verify all components update properly

## What Still Needs Work

1. **Skills System**: V2 stores have a different skill structure that needs proper implementation
2. **Storylet System**: V2 narrative store needs proper storylet handling methods
3. **Migration Function**: The storeMigration.ts still has the wrong method name bug
4. **Other Components**: There may be other components still using legacy stores

## Next Steps

1. Complete the component migration for any remaining components
2. Fix the migration utility method names
3. Implement proper V2 store methods for skills and storylets
4. Consider removing legacy stores entirely once migration is complete

## The Root Cause Was

- Components were split between reading from legacy stores (useAppStore) and V2 stores (useCoreGameStore)
- When you made changes in ResourcePanel, it wrote to legacy stores
- But Planner was reading from V2 stores (which were empty)
- This created the illusion of "caching" when it was actually reading from different data sources

This fix ensures all components read from and write to the same V2 store system.
