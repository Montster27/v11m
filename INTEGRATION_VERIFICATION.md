# Integration & Iteration Phase - Verification Checklist

## ✅ 1. Wire Modules Together

### Shared Global Store ✅
- [x] `useAppStore` contains `activeCharacter`, `allocations`, `resources`, `skills`, `storyletFlags`
- [x] `useStoryletStore` contains `activeFlags`, `completedStoryletIds`, `storyletCooldowns`
- [x] Both stores use Zustand persist middleware
- [x] All modules read from unified stores

### Character & Allocations Integration ✅
- [x] `evaluateStorylets()` reads `activeCharacter.attributes` from app store
- [x] Storylet triggers check `allocations` (study/work/social/rest/exercise percentages)
- [x] Character creation sets `activeCharacter` in unified store
- [x] Time allocation sliders update unified `allocations` state

### Storylet to Resource Integration ✅
- [x] Storylet choices with `{ type: "resource", key: "energy", delta: 10 }` call `updateResource()`
- [x] Resource updates trigger storylet re-evaluation after changes
- [x] Resource effects properly capped (energy/stress: 0-100, others: 0-1000)

### Storylet to Skills Integration ✅
- [x] Storylet choices with `{ type: "skillXp", key: "informationWarfare", amount: 50 }` call `addSkillXp()`
- [x] Skills Dashboard updates immediately when storylet choice awards XP
- [x] Skill events tracked with source attribution ('Storylet', 'Manual', etc.)
- [x] SkillsPanel shows real-time progress bars and level calculations

## ✅ 2. Polish UI Flows

### Navigation ✅
- [x] Header shows: **"New Character"** → `/character-creation`
- [x] Header shows: **"Planner"** → `/planner`
- [x] Header shows: **"Quests"** → `/quests`
- [x] Header shows: **"Skills"** → `/skills`
- [x] Active route highlighted with blue background
- [x] NavLink hover effects with subtle transforms

### Planner Page Layout ✅
- [x] **TimeAllocationPanel** (left column) - sliders with validation
- [x] **StoryletPanel** (middle column) - interactive storylets
- [x] **ResourcePanel** (right column) - energy, stress, etc.
- [x] **SkillsPanel** (full width bottom) - skill progress and XP events

### State Persistence ✅
- [x] `useAppStore` persists: `activeCharacter`, `allocations`, `resources`, `skills`, `storyletFlags`, `day`, `userLevel`, `experience`
- [x] `useStoryletStore` persists: `activeFlags`, `completedStoryletIds`, `storyletCooldowns`
- [x] ✅ **Verification**: Page refresh restores slider positions, resource bars, skill XP, active storylets

### Screen Transitions ✅
- [x] Fade-in animation (0.3s) for all pages using `.page-container` class
- [x] Navigation links have hover animations with `translateY(-1px)`
- [x] No blank flashes between route changes
- [x] Mobile responsive - columns stack vertically on small screens

## ✅ 3. Debug & Logging

### Debug Sidebar ✅
- [x] **DebugPanel** component with collapsible "🐞 Debug" tab
- [x] Fixed position on right side of screen
- [x] Real-time JSON view of unified store state
- [x] Updates every second showing current character, allocations, resources, skills, storyletFlags
- [x] Only visible in development mode (`process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`)

### Console Logging ✅
- [x] **Storylet Choices**: `🎭 StoryletChoice: [storylet.name] → [choice.text]`
- [x] **Effects Applied**: `📋 Effects to apply: [effects array]`
- [x] **Skill XP**: `✨ Adding [amount] XP to [skill.name] from [source]`
- [x] **Effect Processing**: `⚙️ Applying effect: [effect object]`
- [x] All logs wrapped in `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')` checks

## 🎯 **Integration Verification Tests**

### Test 1: Character Creation Flow ✅
1. Navigate to `/character-creation`
2. Create character with name "Test Player"
3. Allocate attributes (e.g., high Intelligence, Charisma)
4. Complete character creation
5. ✅ **Expected**: `activeCharacter` set in unified store, Navigation shows character name

### Test 2: Resource & Storylet Integration ✅
1. On `/planner`, adjust sliders to trigger storylets
2. Set `rest: 10%` (low sleep) to trigger "Exhaustion Warning" storylet
3. Choose storylet option that modifies resources
4. ✅ **Expected**: Resource bars update immediately, console logs show effects

### Test 3: Skill XP Integration ✅
1. Trigger storylet with skill XP reward (e.g., "Midterm Mastery" → "Study Group")
2. Choose option that awards `allianceBuilding` XP
3. Open Skills Dashboard or scroll to SkillsPanel
4. ✅ **Expected**: Skills panel shows updated XP, new level if applicable, event in recent activity

### Test 4: State Persistence ✅
1. Adjust sliders to `study: 40%, work: 30%, social: 20%, rest: 10%`
2. Trigger and complete a storylet choice
3. Gain some skill XP and advance character day
4. Refresh browser page (F5)
5. ✅ **Expected**: All state restored - sliders, resources, skills, day counter

### Test 5: Debug Panel ✅
1. Click "🐞 Debug" tab on right side of screen
2. Make a storylet choice or adjust sliders
3. ✅ **Expected**: JSON updates in real-time showing state changes

## 📋 **Production Readiness Checklist**

- [x] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [x] Zustand persist middleware properly configured
- [x] State management unified across all modules
- [x] Real-time updates between storylets and skills
- [x] Console logging for development debugging
- [x] Debug panel for QA and testing
- [x] Smooth UI transitions and responsive design
- [x] Error boundaries and graceful fallbacks
- [x] Memory bank documentation updated

## 🏆 **Final Integration Status: COMPLETE**

The Integration & Iteration phase has successfully delivered:
- ✅ **Unified Store**: All modules share single state source
- ✅ **Module Integration**: Characters, storylets, skills work together seamlessly
- ✅ **State Persistence**: Browser refresh maintains all progress
- ✅ **Enhanced Navigation**: Smooth transitions and clear routing
- ✅ **Debug Tools**: Development panel and console logging
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and optimization

**Next Steps**: The core integration is complete. Future enhancements can focus on content expansion, advanced features, and user experience improvements.
