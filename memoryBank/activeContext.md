- âœ… **Clipboard Integration**: Perfectly formatted storylet copied to clipboard
- âœ… **Clear Instructions**: Console shows exactly which file to edit and how
- âœ… **Immediate Testing**: Changes work instantly in current session
- âœ… **Streamlined Process**: 4-step workflow for persistence

### 3. New Workflow âœ…
- âœ… Edit storylet in browser interface (works immediately)
- âœ… Properly formatted storylet automatically copied to clipboard
- âœ… Console shows target file and clear instructions
- âœ… Paste into correct data file and save
- âœ… Changes now persist across restarts

### 4. Technical Improvements âœ…
- âœ… `formatStoryletForFile()`: Creates properly indented TypeScript format
- âœ… `generateEnhancedInstructions()`: Clear, actionable guidance

- âœ… Ready-to-paste format with correct commas and indentation
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and fallback methods

### 5. User Experience Enhancements âœ…
- âœ… Clear success messages indicating what was copied
- âœ… Specific file paths and storylet IDs
- âœ… Visual indicators (âœ… ðŸ“‹ ðŸŽ¯) for better readability
- âœ… Step-by-step instructions in logical order
- âœ… Immediate feedback that changes are working in current session

## File Structure Reference
- `immediateStorylets.ts` - Day 1-2 storylets
