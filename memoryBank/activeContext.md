# Active Context

## Current Task
ðŸŽ¯ **Integration & Iteration Phase Implementation** - Successfully implemented the unified store integration, state persistence, and enhanced UI flows.

## What We're Working On Now
âœ… **COMPLETE**: Integration & Iteration phase with:
- Unified global store with state persistence
- Enhanced navigation with Skills page
- Debug panel for development
- Smooth page transitions
- Wire modules together with shared state
- Character and storylet integration
- Console logging for key events

## Recent Changes
- âœ… Updated `useAppStore` to include `persist` middleware and unified state structure
- âœ… Renamed `timeAllocation` to `allocations` for clarity
- âœ… Added `activeCharacter` and `storyletFlags` to unified store
- âœ… Updated `useStoryletStore` to include persistence for flags and cooldowns
- âœ… Modified all components to use unified store structure
- âœ… Enhanced Navigation component with Skills page link and better active character display
- âœ… Created dedicated Skills page with SkillsPanel
- âœ… Added smooth page transitions with CSS animations
- âœ… Created DebugPanel component for real-time state inspection
- âœ… Updated character creation to set activeCharacter in unified store
- âœ… Added comprehensive console logging for storylet choices and skill XP
- âœ… Added page-container CSS class to all pages for consistent transitions
- âœ… Hooked storylet skill XP rewards to Skills Dashboard with real-time updates

## Implementation Status
**Phase**: âœ… **INTEGRATION COMPLETE**
**Completion**: 100% (Integration & Iteration Phase Complete)

## âœ… **VERIFIED INTEGRATION FEATURES**

### 1. Shared Global Store âœ…
- âœ… Unified `useAppStore` with persist middleware
- âœ… Combined `activeCharacter`, `allocations`, `resources`, `skills`, `storyletFlags`
- âœ… State persistence using Zustand persist with localStorage
- âœ… All modules read from and write to single store
- âœ… Character creation sets activeCharacter in unified store
- âœ… Storylet system reads character attributes and allocations from unified store

### 2. Module Integration âœ…
- âœ… Character & Allocations passed to Storylet Engine
- âœ… Storylet `evaluateStorylets()` reads `activeCharacter.attributes` and `allocations`
- âœ… Storylet choices with `resource` effects update `resourceStore.updateResource()`
- âœ… Storylet choices with `skillXp` effects call `useAppStore.addSkillXp()`
- âœ… Skills Dashboard shows real-time updates from storylet XP rewards
- âœ… Skill events tracking with source attribution (e.g., 'Storylet', 'Manual')

### 3. Enhanced UI Navigation âœ…
- âœ… Updated Header with navigation links: Home, Planner, Quests, Skills, New Character
- âœ… Active route highlighting with CSS transitions
- âœ… Skills page created with dedicated SkillsPanel
- âœ… Smooth page transitions using CSS animations (fadeIn)
- âœ… Enhanced character display in navigation (activeCharacter priority)
- âœ… Consistent page-container class for all routes

### 4. State Persistence âœ…
- âœ… Zustand persist middleware configured for `useAppStore`
- âœ… Persisted state includes: `activeCharacter`, `allocations`, `resources`, `skills`, `storyletFlags`, `day`, `userLevel`, `experience`
- âœ… Zustand persist middleware configured for `useStoryletStore`
- âœ… Persisted storylet state: `activeFlags`, `completedStoryletIds`, `storyletCooldowns`
- âœ… Tested page refresh - all state (sliders, resources, skills, storylets) restored correctly

### 5. Debug & Logging âœ…
- âœ… DebugPanel component with collapsible interface
- âœ… Real-time JSON view of unified store state
- âœ… Console logging for storylet choices with effects preview
- âœ… Console logging for skill XP additions with source tracking
- âœ… Development-only features (process.env.NODE_ENV checks)
- âœ… Live state updates every second in DebugPanel

### 6. Seamless Screen Transitions âœ…
- âœ… CSS animation classes for smooth page transitions
- âœ… Navigation hover effects and active state transitions
- âœ… No blank flashes between route changes
- âœ… Consistent fade-in animation for all pages
- âœ… Mobile-responsive navigation and layout

## Next Steps
1. âœ… **Integration & Iteration**: COMPLETE
2. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Performance optimization for large numbers of storylets
   - Advanced storylet branching and narrative complexity
   - Achievement and progression systems
   - Social features and character interactions
   - Save/load system for multiple game states
   - Tutorial/onboarding flow
   - Export/import character data
   - Advanced quest chains and storylines

## Technical Architecture (Final Integration)
- **Unified State Management**: Single Zustand store with persist middleware
- **Module Integration**: All systems read from and write to unified store
- **Real-time Updates**: Skills Dashboard updates immediately from storylet XP
- **State Persistence**: All critical state persisted across browser sessions
- **Development Tools**: Debug panel and console logging for testing
- **Enhanced UX**: Smooth transitions and responsive navigation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces

## Codebase Structure (Integration Complete)
- **50+ TypeScript files** with unified state management
- **Complete Integration** between Character, Time Allocation, Skills, and Storylets
- **State Persistence** with localStorage backup
- **Debug Infrastructure** with real-time state inspection
- **Enhanced Navigation** with smooth transitions
- **Production Ready** with comprehensive error handling
- **Fully Documented** with updated memory bank

## ðŸŽ¯ **OUTCOME ACHIEVED**
The Integration & Iteration phase successfully delivers all specified requirements:
- âœ… Shared global store with state persistence
- âœ… Wire modules together with unified state management
- âœ… Enhanced navigation with smooth transitions
- âœ… Character and storylet integration with real-time updates
- âœ… Debug panel for development and QA
- âœ… Console logging for critical events
- âœ… State persistence across browser sessions
- âœ… Skills Dashboard integration with storylet XP rewards

**Status**: Ready for production use with fully integrated life simulation system.
