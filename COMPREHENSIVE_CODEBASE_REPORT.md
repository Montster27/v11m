All storylet content has been cleared for fresh content development, but the structure supports:

**Storylet Schema:**
```typescript
interface Storylet {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                  // Display title
  description: string;           // Narrative text
  trigger: {                     // Availability conditions
    type: "time" | "flag" | "resource" | "npc_relationship" | "npc_availability";
    conditions: Record<string, any>;
  };
  choices: Choice[];             // Available player actions
  deploymentStatus: 'dev' | 'stage' | 'live';
  storyArc?: string;            // Optional narrative grouping
  involvedNPCs?: string[];      // NPC integration
}
```

**Choice Effects System:**
```typescript
type Effect = 
  | { type: "resource"; key: ResourceType; delta: number }
  | { type: "skillXp"; key: string; amount: number }
  | { type: "flag"; key: string; value: boolean }
  | { type: "minigame"; gameId: MinigameType; onSuccess/onFailure: Effect[] }
  | { type: "clueDiscovery"; clueId: string; minigameType?: MinigameType }
  | { type: "npcRelationship"; npcId: string; delta: number }
  | { type: "npcMemory"; npcId: string; memory: NPCMemoryInput }
  | { type: "unlock"; storyletId: string }
```

**Content Files (Currently Empty for Fresh Development):**

- `frequentStorylets.ts`: Recurring events
- `immediateStorylets.ts`: Quick interaction events
- `minigameStorylets.ts`: Minigame-integrated narratives
- `emmaRomanceArc.ts`: Character relationship storylines

### Character System Data
**V2 Character Schema (Chickering Seven Vectors):**
```typescript
interface IntegratedCharacter {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: 2;
  
  // Seven development domains
  intellectualCompetence: CharacterDomain;
  physicalCompetence: CharacterDomain;
  emotionalIntelligence: CharacterDomain;
  socialCompetence: CharacterDomain;
  personalAutonomy: CharacterDomain;
  identityClarity: CharacterDomain;
  lifePurpose: CharacterDomain;
  
  totalDevelopmentPoints: number;

### Main Application (`src/App.tsx`)
**Routing Structure:**
- **Router**: BrowserRouter for client-side routing

- **Protected Routes**: Require character selection

**Route Configuration:**
- `/` → Redirects to `/planner`
- `/planner` → Main time allocation dashboard
- `/quests` → Quest system interface  
- `/skills` → Skill progression tracking
- `/character-creation` → Character creation flow
- `/storylet-developer` → Development tools (dev only)

**Global Systems Integration:**

- Clue Notification system
- Clue Discovery Manager with full flow
- Debug Panel (development only)
- Error Boundary for graceful failure handling

**Page Components (`src/pages/`):**

## 7. Key Functions & Event Loops

### Core Simulation Engine
**Main Game Loop** (`Planner.tsx`):
```typescript
const simulateTick = () => {
  // 3-second interval = 1 in-game day
  // Resource calculation based on time allocation
  // Day advancement with storylet re-evaluation
  // Crash condition checking (energy ≤ 0, stress ≥ 100)
}
```

**Resource Update Flow:**
1. User adjusts time allocation sliders
2. `updateTimeAllocation()` validates total ≤ 100%
3. Simulation tick calculates resource deltas
4. `updateResource()` applies changes with bounds checking
5. Storylet evaluation triggered for new conditions

**Storylet Evaluation Engine** (`useStoryletStore.ts`):
```typescript
const evaluateStorylets = () => {
  // Complex trigger evaluation system
  // Time-based: day/week conditions
  // Flag-based: story progression states
  // Resource-based: min/max thresholds
  // NPC-based: relationship levels and availability
  // Deployment filtering: dev/stage/live content
}
```

### Character Development Integration
**V2 Character System Flow:**
1. Activities generate domain XP based on allocation
2. Domain advancement triggers stage progression
3. Stage advancement sets storylet flags
4. New storylets unlock based on development milestones

### Minigame Integration
**Minigame Lifecycle:**
1. Storylet choice triggers minigame effect
2. Time simulation pauses (`isTimePaused = true`)
3. Minigame launches with success/failure effects
4. Completion applies appropriate effects
5. Storylet marked complete, time resumes

### Save System Integration
**Auto-Save Triggers:**
- Day advancement
- Storylet completion
- Character development milestones
- Manual save requests

## 8. Styling & Theming

### Tailwind CSS Configuration
**File**: `tailwind.config.js`
- Standard Tailwind configuration
- Content paths include all source files
- No custom theme extensions (using default palette)

**CSS Organization:**
- `src/index.css`: Global styles and Tailwind directives
- `src/App.css`: Application-specific styles
- Component-level styling via Tailwind utility classes

**Design System Patterns:**
- **Colors**: Consistent color palette (teal primary, gray neutrals)
- **Typography**: Font weights (medium, semibold, bold) with size hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Standard Tailwind spacing scale
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with variant support
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design patterns

**Theme Support:**
- Light/dark theme structure in store
