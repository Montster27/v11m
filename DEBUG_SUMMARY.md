# V11M2 Store Migration Debug Summary

## The Problem
User reported a "caching" issue where code changes weren't taking effect. Browser storage clearing and migrations didn't fix it.

## What We've Tried

### 1. Initial Diagnosis
- Identified dual store architecture: Legacy (`useAppStore`) vs V2 stores (`useCoreGameStore`)
- Found components were split between using different stores
- ResourcePanel, TimeAllocationPanel, SkillsPanel were using legacy stores
- Planner was using V2 stores

### 2. Migration Fixes
- Fixed broken migration function (was calling `updatePlayerStats()` instead of `updatePlayer()`)
- Updated all components to import from V2 stores:
  - ResourcePanel.tsx → `useCoreGameStore`
  - TimeAllocationPanel.tsx → `useCoreGameStore`
  - SkillsPanel.tsx → `useCoreGameStore` (partial)
  - StoryletPanel.tsx → `useNarrativeStore` (partial)

### 3. Diagnostic Tools Created
- `testV2Migration()` - Tests migration status
- `diagnoseStoreIssue()` - Deep diagnosis of store instances
- `forceStoreUpdate()` - Forces store updates
- `ultimateDiagnostic()` - Comprehensive test (caused trigger.type error)
- `safeStoreDiagnostic()` - Safe version that avoids errors
- `checkImportResolution()` - Tests import paths
- `versionCheck()` - Confirms code updates are being served

### 4. Current Status
- **Code IS being served**: Version check shows `2024-12-19-FIX-3`
- **But components still use old stores**: Despite file updates
- This suggests either:
  - Module resolution cache issue
  - Import path problem
  - HMR not updating component instances
  - Bundler serving cached modules

## Next Steps for New Chat
1. Run `safeStoreDiagnostic()` to confirm which store is being used
2. Check if it's a Vite HMR issue
3. Consider if there's a provider/context wrapper overriding imports
4. May need to clear node_modules/.vite cache
5. Check for multiple dev server instances

## Key Finding
This is NOT a simple caching issue. The browser IS getting updated code (version check proves this), but the components are still using old store instances at runtime. This points to a deeper module resolution or bundling issue.
